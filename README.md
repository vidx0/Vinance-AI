Problem: Financial education among young adults is often inadequate, leading to poor savings habits and missed opportunities to build wealth.

Approach: To address this, Iâ€™m developing an AI-powered financial agent designed to educate young adults and guide them in making smarter financial decisions, from saving strategies to long-term wealth-building plans.

Structure: The AI agent will feature tools for personalized budgeting, investment suggestions, and expense tracking, alongside educational resources and actionable tips to improve financial literacy.
