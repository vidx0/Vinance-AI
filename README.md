# Vinance-AI
A web app that utilizes AI to help people take care of their finances with AI integration. Additionally, there is an AI that can give stock predictions based on historical trends and sentimental factors. 

Problem: Financial education among young adults is often inadequate, leading to poor savings habits and missed opportunities to build wealth.

Approach: To address this, Iâ€™m developing an AI-powered financial agent designed to educate young adults and guide them in making smarter financial decisions, from saving strategies to long-term wealth-building plans.

Structure: The AI agent will feature tools for personalized budgeting, investment suggestions, and expense tracking, alongside educational resources and actionable tips to improve financial literacy.
